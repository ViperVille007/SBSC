Let's use python program to solve the problem in sequential order.
DO NOT USE ANY TEXTUAL REASONING.
Your response must start with: ```python 
Your response must end with: print(result)

Once you get the code output, just display the output answer within `\boxed{}` and terminate.
Here are some examples you may refer to.

Example 1:

Problem: A frog begins at $P_0 = (0,0)$ and makes a sequence of jumps according to the following rule: from $P_n = (x_n, y_n),$ the frog jumps to $P_{n+1},$ which may be any of the points $(x_n + 7, y_n + 2),$ $(x_n + 2, y_n + 7),$ $(x_n - 5, y_n - 10),$ or $(x_n - 10, y_n - 5).$ There are $M$ points $(x, y)$ with $|x| + |y| \le 100$ that can be reached by a sequence of such jumps. Find the remainder when $M$ is divided by $1000.$

Breakdown : 
1. What are the possible hops representing the frog's possible jumps?
2. What is the maximum value of \(|x| + |y|\) based on the frog's initial position and jump options?
3. How does this limit affect which points are reachable?
4. How can we count all the points \((x, y)\) such that \(|x| + |y| \le 100\) and they are reachable?
5. Once all reachable points are counted, how do we find the remainder when this count is divided by 1000?

Solution:
 
```python
from collections import deque

def solution():
    #What are the possible hops representing the frog's possible jumps?
    jumps = [(7, 2), (2, 7), (-5, -10), (-10, -5)]
    # Initialize the queue with the starting point
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    # Set to keep track of visited points
    visited = set()
    visited.add((0, 0))
    
    #What is the maximum value of \(|x| + |y|\) based on the frog's initial position and jump options?
    def within_bounds(x, y):
        return abs(x) + abs(y) <= 100
    # What method can be used to efficiently enumerate these points?
    # BFS to explore all reachable points
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        
        for dx, dy in jumps:
            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy
            # How can we count all the points \((x, y)\) such that \(|x| + |y| \le 100\) and they are reachable?
            if within_bounds(next_x, next_y) and (next_x, next_y) not in visited:
                visited.add((next_x, next_y))
                queue.append((next_x, next_y))
    
    # The number of unique, reachable points
    M = len(visited)
    
    # Once all reachable points are counted, how do we find the remainder when this count is divided by 1000?
    result = M % 1000
    return result

result = solution()
print(result)
```
```output
\boxed{373}

The answer is \boxed{373}

Example 2: 

Problem: The AIME Triathlon consists of a half-mile swim, a 30-mile bicycle ride, and an eight-mile run. Tom swims, bicycles, and runs at constant rates. He runs fives times as fast as he swims, and he bicycles twice as fast as he runs. Tom completes the AIME Triathlon in four and a quarter hours. How many minutes does he spend bicycling?

Breakdown:
1. If Tom runs five times as fast as he swims, how can we express his running speed in terms of his swimming speed?
2. If Tom bicycles twice as fast as he runs, how can we express his bicycling speed in terms of his running speed, and consequently in terms of his swimming speed?
3. How can we set up an equation and solve it using the total time Tom takes to complete the triathlon and the expressions for the time spent swimming, running, and bicycling?
4. If we have Tom's swimming speed how do we calculate his bicycling speed?
5. How do we convert the time spent bicycling from hours into minutes?

Solution:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solution():
    # Define the swimming speed as a variable
    s = symbols('s')  # Swimming speed in miles per hour


    # If Tom runs five times as fast as he swims, how can we express his running speed in terms of his swimming speed?
    r = 5 * s  
    # If Tom bicycles twice as fast as he runs, how can we express his bicycling speed in terms of his running speed, and consequently in terms of his swimming speed?
    b = 2 * r  

    # # How can we set up an equation and solve it using the total time Tom takes to complete the triathlon and the expressions for the time spent swimming, running, and bicycling?
    t_swim = 0.5 / s  # Time spent swimming
    t_bike = 30 / b   # Time spent bicycling
    t_run = 8 / r     # Time spent running
    # Total time is 4.25 hours
    total_time = 4.25
    # Set up the equation for total time
    equation = Eq(t_swim + t_bike + t_run, total_time)
    # Solve for swimming speed s
    sol = solve(equation, s)
    swimming_speed = sol[0]

    # If we have Tom's swimming speed how do we calculate his bicycling speed?
    bicycling_speed = 10 * swimming_speed
    time_bicycling = 30 / bicycling_speed  # Time in hours

    # How do we convert the time spent bicycling from hours into minutes?
    time_bicycling_minutes = time_bicycling * 60

    return time_bicycling_minutes

result = solution()
print(result)
```
```output
\boxed{150}
```
The answer is \boxed{150}

Example 3: 
Problem: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$ . Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$

Breakdown:
1. How do we initialize the smallest number with 8 ones ?
2. How can we find the next number in the Sequence $S$ with 8 ones if we have already have a number in the sequence ?
3. How do we find the 1000th number in the Sequence $S$?
4. Once the 1000th number is identified, how do we perform the division to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000?

Solution:

```python
def solution():
    # How do we initialize the smallest number with 8 ones ?
    n = (1 << 8) - 1  # 11111111 in binary, which is 255 in decimal

    # How can we find the next number in the Sequence $S$ with 8 ones if we have already have a number in the sequence ?
    def next_number_with_h_ones(num, ones):
        while bin(num).count('1') != ones:
            num += 1
        return num

    # How do we find the 1000th number in the Sequence $S$?
    for _ in range(999):
        n = next_number_with_h_ones(n + 1, 8)

    # Once the 1000th number is identified, how do we perform the division to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000?
    remainder = n % 1000

    return remainder

result = solution()
print(result)
```
```output
\boxed{32}
```
The answer is \boxed{32}


Example 4:
Problem: Two geometric sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots$ have the same common ratio, with $a_1 = 27$ $b_1=99$ , and $a_{15}=b_{11}$ . Find $a_9$

Breakdown:
1. Given that the sequences have the same common ratio, how can we express \(a_{15}\) and \(b_{11}\) in terms of \(a_1\), \(b_1\), and the common ratio?
2. Using the condition \(a_{15} = b_{11}\), what equation can we establish involving the common ratio?
3. How can we solve the equation from the previous step to find the common ratio?
4. If there are multiple solutions how do we find the positive ones ?
5. Once the common ratio is known, how can we calculate \(a_9\) using the first term \(a_1\) and the common ratio?


Solution:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solution():
    # Given that the sequences have the same common ratio, how can we express \(a_{15}\) and \(b_{11}\) in terms of \(a_1\), \(b_1\), and the common ratio?
    r = symbols('r', positive=True, real=True)
    # Given values
    a1 = 27
    b1 = 99
    a_15 = a1 * r**14
    b_11 = b1 * r**10

    # Using the condition \(a_{15} = b_{11}\), what equation can we establish involving the common ratio?
    equation = Eq(a_15, b1_11)

    # How can we solve the equation from the previous step to find the common ratio?
    solution_r = solve(equation, r)
    # If there are multiple solutions how do we find the positive ones ?
    common_ratio = solution_r[0] if solution_r[0] > 0 else solution_r[1]

    # Once the common ratio is known, how can we calculate \(a_9\) using the first term \(a_1\) and the common ratio?
    a_9 = a1 * common_ratio**8

    return a_9

# Print the result
result = solution()
print(result)
```
```output
\boxed{363}
```
The answer is \boxed{363}
