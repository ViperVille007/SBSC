Break down the given problem.

Here are some examples you may refer to.

Example 1:
Problem: Small lights are hung on a string $6$ inches apart in the order red, red, green, green, green, red, red, green, green, green, and so on continuing this pattern of $2$ red lights followed by $3$ green lights. How many feet separate the 3rd red light and the 21st red light? Note: $1$ foot is equal to $12$ inches.

Breakdown: 

1. How many lights are there in each complete cycle of the pattern?
2. If we know the cycle length how do we find the positions of the 3rd red light and the 21st red light in the sequence?
3. If we know the positions of 3rd red light and 21st red light how do we find number of lights between them ?
4. What is the total distance in inches between the 3rd red light and the 21st red light?
5. How many feet does the distance between the 3rd and 21st red lights convert to, given that 1 foot equals 12 inches?

Example 2:
Problem: A fruit salad consists of blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and cherries.  The fruit salad has a total of $280$ pieces of fruit.  There are twice as many raspberries as blueberries, three times as many grapes as cherries, and four times as many cherries as raspberries.  How many cherries are there in the fruit salad?

Breakdown:
1. How can we set up an equation using the given relations between number of fruits and the total number of pieces of fruit, which is 280 ?
2. How can we simplify the equation using the relationships between the different types of fruit to solve for one variable?
3. Once the equation is simplified to one variable, how can we solve for the number of cherries?

Example 3:
Problem: Last summer $30\%$ of the birds living on Town Lake were geese, $25\%$ were swans, $10\%$ were herons, and $35\%$ were ducks. What percent of the birds that were not swans were geese?

Breakdown:
1. What percentage of the birds were not swans?
2. Given the percentage of birds that are not swans, what percentage of these non-swan birds were geese?


Example 4:
Problem: At a twins and triplets convention, there were $9$ sets of twins and $6$ sets of triplets, all from different families. Each twin shook hands with all the twins except his/her siblings and with half the triplets. Each triplet shook hands with all the triplets except his/her siblings and with half the twins. How many handshakes took place?

Breakdown:
1. How to get the total number of triplets and twins?
2. What is the total number of handshakes among all twins?
3. How many triplets does each twin shake hands with, given that they shake hands with half of them?
4. What is the total number of handshakes among all triplets?
5. What is the total number of handshakes that occur at the convention when combining all the above scenarios?
