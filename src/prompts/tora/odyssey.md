Integrate step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve math problems using the following guidelines:

- Analyze the question and write functions to solve the problem; the function should not take any arguments.
- Present the final result in LaTeX using a `\boxed{}` without any units.
- Utilize the `pi` symbol and `Rational`` from Sympy for $\pi$ and fractions, and simplify all fractions and square roots without converting them to decimal values.

Once you get the code output, just display the output answer within `\boxed{}` and terminate.
Here are some examples you may refer to:

Example Problem: A frog begins at $P_0 = (0,0)$ and makes a sequence of jumps according to the following rule: from $P_n = (x_n, y_n),$ the frog jumps to $P_{n+1},$ which may be any of the points $(x_n + 7, y_n + 2),$ $(x_n + 2, y_n + 7),$ $(x_n - 5, y_n - 10),$ or $(x_n - 10, y_n - 5).$ There are $M$ points $(x, y)$ with $|x| + |y| \le 100$ that can be reached by a sequence of such jumps. Find the remainder when $M$ is divided by $1000.$

Example Solution:
Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

1. We need to find all points (x, y) that the frog can reach within the given constraint |x| + |y| ≤ 100.
2. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible points.
3. We'll keep track of visited points to avoid revisiting them.
4. We'll count the number of unique points visited.

Here's the Python code to solve this:

```python
from collections import deque
def count_reachable_points():
    # Possible jumps
    jumps = [(7, 2), (2, 7), (-5, -10), (-10, -5)]
    visited = set([(0, 0)])
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in jumps:
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            # Check if the new point is within the constraint and not visited
            if abs(new_x) + abs(new_y) <= 100 and (new_x, new_y) not in visited:
                visited.add((new_x, new_y))
                queue.append((new_x, new_y))
    # Count reachable points
    M = len(visited)
    # Return the remainder when M is divided by 1000
    return M % 1000
result = count_reachable_points()
print(f"\\boxed{{{result}}}")
```
```output
\boxed{373}
```
The answer is \boxed{373}



Example Problem: The AIME Triathlon consists of a half-mile swim, a 30-mile bicycle ride, and an eight-mile run. Tom swims, bicycles, and runs at constant rates. He runs fives times as fast as he swims, and he bicycles twice as fast as he runs. Tom completes the AIME Triathlon in four and a quarter hours. How many minutes does he spend bicycling?

Example Solution:
Let's approach this problem step-by-step:
1. Let's define variables:
   - Let x be Tom's swimming speed in miles per hour
   - Then 5x is his running speed in miles per hour
   - And 10x is his bicycling speed in miles per hour
2. We can set up equations based on the given information:
   - Swimming time: 0.5 / x hours
   - Bicycling time: 30 / (10x) hours
   - Running time: 8 / (5x) hours
3. The total time is 4.25 hours, so we can set up an equation:
   0.5/x + 30/(10x) + 8/(5x) = 4.25
4. Let's solve this equation and find the bicycling time.

Here's the Python code to solve this:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational
def solve_triathlon():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Set up the equation
    eq = Eq(Rational(1,2)/x + 30/(10*x) + 8/(5*x), Rational(17,4))
    # Solve the equation
    solution = solve(eq)[0]
    # Calculate bicycling time in hours
    bike_time = 30 / (10 * solution)
    # Convert to minutes
    bike_time_minutes = int(bike_time * 60)
    return f"\\boxed{{{bike_time_minutes}}}"
print(solve_triathlon())
```
```output
\boxed{150}
```
The answer is \boxed{150}


Example Problem: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$ . Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$

Example Solution:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. We need to generate the sequence S of numbers with exactly 8 ones in their binary representation.
2. We'll find the 1000th number in this sequence.
3. Finally, we'll calculate the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.

Here's the Python code to solve this:
```python
def count_ones(n):
    return bin(n).count('1')
def solution():
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while count < 1000:
        if count_ones(n) == 8:
            count += 1
            if count == 1000:
                return n % 1000
        n += 1
result = solution()
print(result)
```
```output
\boxed{32}
```
The answer is \boxed{32}



Example Problem: Two geometric sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots$ have the same common ratio, with $a_1 = 27$ $b_1=99$ , and $a_{15}=b_{11}$ . Find $a_9$

Example Solution:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Let's denote the common ratio as r.
2. We can express a₁₅ and b₁₁ in terms of their first terms and r.
3. We can then equate these expressions to find r.
4. Once we have r, we can calculate a₉.

Here's the Python code to solve this:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational
def find_a9():
    r = symbols('r')
    # a₁₅ = a₁ * r¹⁴
    # b₁₁ = b₁ * r¹⁰
    # a₁₅ = b₁₁
    eq = Eq(27 * r**14, 99 * r**10)
    # Solve for r
    solution = solve(eq)
    # We expect only one positive real solution
    r_value = [sol for sol in solution if sol.is_real and sol > 0][0]    
    # Calculate a₉
    a9 = 27 * r_value**8
    return a9
result = find_a9()
print(f"\\boxed{{{result}}}")
```
```output
\boxed{363}
```
The answer is \boxed{363}
