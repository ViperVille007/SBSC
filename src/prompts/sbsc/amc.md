You are given a math problem and you need to think of a stepwise approach/process to be followed to solve the problem. Use sympy-based python code to codify each of these steps in sequential manner. 
You must end each of your code snippet with a print statement followed by ```output in the next line. 
Use the results from the output of the code snippets of each step and continue to the next step until you finish the final step and solve the problem completely. 
In each new code block, you must define the variables and symbols again based on the previous code snippets or their outputs as suitable.
Use sympy in appropriate way, as and when required.
Once you complete the last step, write this line: ### END OF CODE
Then just print the final numeric answer (without any units) like this: The final answer is \\boxed{}.
If the executed code snippet returns an error, use it to correct the current step's code snippet. DO NOT restart solving from Step 1.

Here are a few examples for your reference.

Example Problem: Small lights are hung on a string $6$ inches apart in the order red, red, green, green, green, red, red, green, green, green, and so on continuing this pattern of $2$ red lights followed by $3$ green lights. How many feet separate the 3rd red light and the 21st red light? Note: $1$ foot is equal to $12$ inches.

Example Solution: 
Let's solve this problem step by step using SymPy-based Python code.

### Step 1: Define the pattern and calculate the number of lights in one complete pattern

```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational
# Define the number of red and green lights in one pattern
red_lights_per_pattern = 2
green_lights_per_pattern = 3
# Calculate total lights in one pattern
lights_per_pattern = red_lights_per_pattern + green_lights_per_pattern
print(f"Number of lights in one complete pattern: {lights_per_pattern}")
```
```output
Number of lights in one complete pattern: 5
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 2: Calculate the number of complete patterns between the 3rd and 21st red lights

```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational
# Define the number of red lights we're considering
start_red_light = 3
end_red_light = 21
# Calculate the number of red lights between the 3rd and 21st (inclusive)
red_lights_between = end_red_light - start_red_light + 1
# Calculate the number of complete patterns
complete_patterns = (red_lights_between - 1) // 2
print(f"Number of complete patterns between the 3rd and 21st red lights: {complete_patterns}")
```
```output
Number of complete patterns between the 3rd and 21st red lights: 9
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 3: Calculate the total number of lights between the 3rd and 21st red lights

```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational
# Define the number of red and green lights in one pattern
red_lights_per_pattern = 2
green_lights_per_pattern = 3
lights_per_pattern = red_lights_per_pattern + green_lights_per_pattern
# Number of complete patterns
complete_patterns = 9
# Calculate total lights
total_lights = complete_patterns * lights_per_pattern + 1  # +1 for the 21st red light
print(f"Total number of lights between the 3rd and 21st red lights (inclusive): {total_lights}")
```
```output
Total number of lights between the 3rd and 21st red lights (inclusive): 46
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 4: Calculate the total distance in inches

```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational
# Total number of lights
total_lights = 46
# Distance between lights in inches
distance_between_lights = 6
# Calculate total distance in inches
total_distance_inches = (total_lights - 1) * distance_between_lights
print(f"Total distance in inches: {total_distance_inches}")
```
```output
Total distance in inches: 270
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 5: Convert the distance from inches to feet

```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational
# Total distance in inches
total_distance_inches = 270
# Convert inches to feet
inches_per_foot = 12
total_distance_feet = Rational(total_distance_inches, inches_per_foot)
print(f"Total distance in feet: {total_distance_feet}")
```
```output
Total distance in feet: 45/2
```
### END OF CODE
The final answer is \boxed{45/2}
