You are given a math problem and you need to think of a stepwise approach/process to be followed to solve the problem. Use sympy-based python code to codify each of these steps in sequential manner. 
You must end each of your code snippet with a print statement followed by ```output in the next line. 
Use the results from the output of the code snippets of each step and continue to the next step until you finish the final step and solve the problem completely. 
In each new code block, you must define the variables and symbols again based on the previous code snippets or their outputs as suitable.
Use sympy in appropriate way, as and when required.
Once you complete the last step, write this line: ### END OF CODE
Then just print the final numeric answer (without any units) like this: The final answer is \\boxed{}.
If the executed code snippet returns an error, use it to correct the current step's code snippet. DO NOT restart solving from Step 1.

Here are a few examples for your reference.

Example Problem: A frog begins at $P_0 = (0,0)$ and makes a sequence of jumps according to the following rule: from $P_n = (x_n, y_n),$ the frog jumps to $P_{n+1},$ which may be any of the points $(x_n + 7, y_n + 2),$ $(x_n + 2, y_n + 7),$ $(x_n - 5, y_n - 10),$ or $(x_n - 10, y_n - 5).$ There are $M$ points $(x, y)$ with $|x| + |y| \le 100$ that can be reached by a sequence of such jumps. Find the remainder when $M$ is divided by $1000.$

Example Solution:
Let's approach this problem step by step using SymPy-based Python code.

### Step 1: Import necessary libraries and define the jump rules
```python
from sympy import symbols, Abs
import numpy as np

# Define the possible jumps from any position (x, y)
def jumps(x, y):
    return [
        (x + 7, y + 2),   # Jump by (7, 2)
        (x + 2, y + 7),   # Jump by (2, 7)
        (x - 5, y - 10),  # Jump by (-5, -10)
        (x - 10, y - 5)   # Jump by (-10, -5)
    ]

print("Jump rules defined.")
```
```output
Jump rules defined.
```
Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.

### Step 2: Implement a breadth-first search to find all reachable points

```python
from sympy import symbols, Abs
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

# Reuse the jumps function to define possible moves
def jumps(x, y):
    return [
        (x + 7, y + 2),   
        (x + 2, y + 7),   
        (x - 5, y - 10),  
        (x - 10, y - 5)   
    ]

# Define the breadth-first search (BFS) function
def bfs():
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])  # Start BFS from the point (0, 0)
    visited = set([(0, 0)])  # Keep track of visited points to avoid reprocessing
    
    # Process each point in the queue
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()  
        for nx, ny in jumps(x, y):  # Try all possible jumps from the current point
            if (nx, ny) not in visited and abs(nx) + abs(ny) <= 100:
                visited.add((nx, ny))  # Mark the new point as visited
                queue.append((nx, ny))  # Add the new point to the queue to explore further
    
    return len(visited)  y

M = bfs()
print(f"Number of reachable points (M): {M}")
```
```output
Number of reachable points (M): 1373
```
Let's continue with the final step to solve this problem.

### Step 3: Calculate the remainder when M is divided by 1000

```python
from sympy import symbols, Abs
import numpy as np

M = 1373  # M_value from previous step
# Find the remainder when M is divided by 1000
remainder = M % 1000
print(f"Remainder when M is divided by 1000: {remainder}")
```
```output
Remainder when M is divided by 1000: 373
```
