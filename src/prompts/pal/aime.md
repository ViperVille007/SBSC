Here are some examples you may refer to.

Example Problem: A frog begins at $P_0 = (0,0)$ and makes a sequence of jumps according to the following rule: from $P_n = (x_n, y_n),$ the frog jumps to $P_{n+1},$ which may be any of the points $(x_n + 7, y_n + 2),$ $(x_n + 2, y_n + 7),$ $(x_n - 5, y_n - 10),$ or $(x_n - 10, y_n - 5).$ There are $M$ points $(x, y)$ with $|x| + |y| \le 100$ that can be reached by a sequence of such jumps. Find the remainder when $M$ is divided by $1000.$

Example Solution:

```python
def solution():
    jumps = [(7, 2), (2, 7), (-5, -10), (-10, -5)]
    # Set to keep track of all reachable points, starting from the origin (0, 0).
    reachable = set([(0, 0)])
    queue = [(0, 0)]
    # Breadth-first search (BFS) to explore reachable points.
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.pop(0)
        for dx, dy in jumps:
            # Calculate new coordinates after the jump.
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            # Check if the Manhattan distance is within 100 and the point hasn't been visited.
            if abs(nx) + abs(ny) <= 100 and (nx, ny) not in reachable:
                reachable.add((nx, ny))
                # Add the new point to the queue to explore further.
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return len(reachable) % 1000
result = solution()
print(result)
```



Example Problem: The AIME Triathlon consists of a half-mile swim, a 30-mile bicycle ride, and an eight-mile run. Tom swims, bicycles, and runs at constant rates. He runs fives times as fast as he swims, and he bicycles twice as fast as he runs. Tom completes the AIME Triathlon in four and a quarter hours. How many minutes does he spend bicycling?

Example Solution:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational
def solution():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Set up the equation
    eq = Eq(Rational(1,2)/x + 30/(10*x) + 8/(5*x), Rational(17,4))
    # Solve the equation
    solution = solve(eq)[0]
    # Calculate bicycling time in hours
    bike_time = 30 / (10 * solution)
    # Convert to minutes
    bike_time_minutes = int(bike_time * 60)
    return bike_time_minutes
result = solution()
print result
```


Example Problem: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$ . Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$

Example Solution:

```python
def solution():
    count = 0  # Initialize a counter to track how many numbers have been found
    n = 1  
    while count < 1000:  
        # Check if the binary representation of the number 'n' has exactly 8 '1's
        if bin(n).count('1') == 8:
            count += 1 
            # If this is the 1000th such number, return the remainder of n divided by 1000
            if count == 1000:
                return n % 1000
        n += 1  # Move to the next number
result = solution()  
print(result)
```


Example Problem: Two geometric sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots$ have the same common ratio, with $a_1 = 27$ $b_1=99$ , and $a_{15}=b_{11}$ . Find $a_9$

Example Solution:

```python
def solution():
    # Initialize known values
    a1 = 27
    b1 = 99
    # Calculate the common ratio
    # We know that a15 = b11, so:
    # a1 * r^14 = b1 * r^10
    # 27 * r^14 = 99 * r^10
    # 27 * r^4 = 99
    # r^4 = 99/27 = 11/3
    r = (11/3) ** (1/4)
    # Calculate a9
    a9 = a1 * (r ** 8)
    return round(a9)
result = solution()
print(result)
```
