Think step-by-step and solve the problem. 

Here are a few examples for your reference.

Example Problem: Small lights are hung on a string $6$ inches apart in the order red, red, green, green, green, red, red, green, green, green, and so on continuing this pattern of $2$ red lights followed by $3$ green lights. How many feet separate the 3rd red light and the 21st red light? Note: $1$ foot is equal to $12$ inches.

Example Solution: 
Let's approach this problem step-by-step:
Step 1: Understand the pattern and count the lights.
The lights are arranged in a repeating pattern of 2 red lights followed by 3 green lights. This pattern repeats itself every 5 lights.
Step 2: Determine the position of each red light.
The 2 red lights appear in positions 1 and 2, then again in positions 6 and 7, and so on. We need to identify the positions of the 3rd and 21st red lights.
The 3rd red light is the first red light in the second repetition of the pattern, which means it is at position 6. 
The 21st red light is the first red light in the 11th repetition of the pattern, which means it is at position 
\[(11-1) \times 5 + 1 = 51.\]
\textbf{Step 3: Calculate the distance between the 3rd and 21st red lights.}
Each light is 6 inches apart. Therefore, the distance between the 6th and 51st lights (positions of the 3rd and 21st red lights) is:
\[51 - 6 = 45 \text{ positions}\]
The distance in inches is:
\[45 \times 6 = 270 \text{ inches}\]
Step 4: Convert inches to feet.
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the distance in feet is:
\[\frac{270 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches per foot}} = 22.5 \text{ feet}\]
Final Answer:
The distance between the 3rd red light and the 21st red light is \boxed{22.5}



Example Problem: A fruit salad consists of blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and cherries.  The fruit salad has a total of $280$ pieces of fruit.  There are twice as many raspberries as blueberries, three times as many grapes as cherries, and four times as many cherries as raspberries.  How many cherries are there in the fruit salad?

Example Solution:
Let's approach this problem step-by-step:
1) Let's define variables for each type of fruit:
   b = number of blueberries
   r = number of raspberries
   g = number of grapes
   c = number of cherries
2) From the given information, we can write these equations:
   r = 2b (twice as many raspberries as blueberries)
   g = 3c (three times as many grapes as cherries)
   c = 4r (four times as many cherries as raspberries)
3) We also know that the total number of fruits is 280:
   b + r + g + c = 280
4) Let's substitute the relationships we know into the total equation:
   b + 2b + 3c + c = 280
   3b + 4c = 280
5) We can also substitute c = 4r and r = 2b into this equation:
   3b + 4(4(2b)) = 280
   3b + 32b = 280
   35b = 280
6) Now we can solve for b:
   b = 280 / 35 = 8
7) Remember, r = 2b, so r = 2(8) = 16
8) And c = 4r, so c = 4(16) = 64
Therefore, there are 64 cherries in the fruit salad.
The answer is \boxed{64}.



Example Problem: Last summer $30\%$ of the birds living on Town Lake were geese, $25\%$ were swans, $10\%$ were herons, and $35\%$ were ducks. What percent of the birds that were not swans were geese?

Example Solution:
Let's approach this problem step-by-step:
1) First, let's identify what we know:
   - 30% of the birds were geese
   - 25% were swans
   - 10% were herons
   - 35% were ducks
2) We need to find what percent of non-swan birds were geese.
3) To do this, we first need to calculate the percentage of birds that were not swans:
   100% - 25% = 75% were not swans
4) Now, we need to find what percentage geese make up of this 75%.
5) We can set up a proportion:
   (Percentage of geese) / (Percentage of non-swans) = x / 100
   Where x is the percentage we're looking for.
6) Plugging in the numbers:
   30 / 75 = x / 100
7) Cross multiply:
   30 * 100 = 75x
8) Solve for x:
   3000 = 75x
   x = 3000 / 75 = 40
Therefore, 40% of the birds that were not swans were geese.
The answer is \boxed{40}.



Example  Problem: At a twins and triplets convention, there were $9$ sets of twins and $6$ sets of triplets, all from different families. Each twin shook hands with all the twins except his/her siblings and with half the triplets. Each triplet shook hands with all the triplets except his/her siblings and with half the twins. How many handshakes took place?

Example Solution:
Let's solve this problem step by step:
1. First, let's count the number of people at the convention:
Number of twins = 9 sets × 2 = 18
Number of triplets = 6 sets × 3 = 18
Total number of people = 18 + 18 = 36
2. Now, let's count the handshakes made by twins:
Each twin shakes hands with all twins except their sibling. So, each twin shakes hands with 16 other twins.
Each twin also shakes hands with half of the triplets, which is 9.
So, each twin makes 16 + 9 = 25 handshakes.
Total handshakes made by twins = 18 × 25 = 450
3. Next, let's count the handshakes made by triplets:
Each triplet shakes hands with all triplets except their siblings. So, each triplet shakes hands with 15 other triplets.
Each triplet also shakes hands with half of the twins, which is 9.
So, each triplet makes 15 + 9 = 24 handshakes.
Total handshakes made by triplets = 18 × 24 = 432
4. However, in steps 2 and 3, we have counted each handshake twice. For example, when a twin shakes hands with a triplet, it's counted in both step 2 and step 3. So, we need to divide the total by 2.
5. Therefore, Total handshakes = (450 + 432) ÷ 2 = 441
The answer is \boxed{441}
