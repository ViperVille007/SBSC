{"problem": "From the natural numbers 1 to 100, choose any \\( m \\) numbers such that among these \\( m \\) numbers, there exists one number that can divide the product of the remaining \\( m-1 \\) numbers. The minimum value of \\( m \\) is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.", "answer": "26", "idx": 145.0}
{"problem": "Several teams are participating in a friendly football match, where any two teams play at most one match against each other. It is known that each team has played 4 matches, and there are no draws. A team is considered a \"weak team\" if it loses at least 2 out of the 4 matches it plays. If there are only 3 \"weak teams\" in this friendly match, then at most how many teams could have participated in the matches?", "answer": "9", "idx": 146.0}
{"problem": "In the equation, the same letter represents the same digit, and different letters represent different digits. Then, the four-digit number \\(\\overline{a b c d}\\) is given by:\n\n$$\n(\\overline{a b})^{c} \\times \\overline{a c d}=\\overline{a b c a c d}\n$$", "answer": "3125", "idx": 147.0}
{"problem": "Let $n$ be represented as the difference of squares of two nonzero natural numbers, then there are $F(n)$ ways to do so.\n\nFor example, $15=8^{2}-7^{2}=4^{2}-1^{2}$, so $F(15)=2$; whereas 2 cannot be represented, hence $F(2)=0$. Then, the calculation result of $F(1)+F(2)+F(3)+\\cdots+F(100)$ is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.", "answer": "116", "idx": 148.0}
