**Question (AIME 2023):**
A plane contains 40 lines, no 2 of which are parallel. 
Suppose that there are 3 points where exactly 3 lines intersect, 4 points where exactly 4 lines intersect, 5 points where exactly 5 lines intersect, 6 points where exactly 6 lines intersect, and no points where more than 6 lines intersect. 
Find the number of points where exactly 2 lines intersect. 

Let's approach this problem step by step using SymPy-based Python code.

### Step 1: Import necessary libraries and define variables
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Define variables
n = 40  # total number of lines
x = symbols('x')  # number of points where exactly 2 lines intersect
# Given information
p3 = 3  # points where 3 lines intersect
p4 = 4  # points where 4 lines intersect
p5 = 5  # points where 5 lines intersect
p6 = 6  # points where 6 lines intersect
print(f"Total lines: {n}")
print(f"Points with 3 lines: {p3}")
print(f"Points with 4 lines: {p4}")
print(f"Points with 5 lines: {p5}")
print(f"Points with 6 lines: {p6}")
```
```output
Total lines: 40
Points with 3 lines: 3
Points with 4 lines: 4
Points with 5 lines: 5
Points with 6 lines: 6
```
Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.


### Step 2: Calculate the total number of intersection points
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables from previous step
n = 40
x = symbols('x')
p3 = 3
p4 = 4
p5 = 5
p6 = 6
# Total number of intersection points
total_intersections = n * (n - 1) // 2
print(f"Total number of intersection points: {total_intersections}")
```
```output
Total number of intersection points: 780
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 3: Set up the equation
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables from previous steps
n = 40
x = symbols('x')
p3 = 3
p4 = 4
p5 = 5
p6 = 6
total_intersections = 780
# Set up the equation
# x + 3*p3 + 6*p4 + 10*p5 + 15*p6 = total_intersections
equation = Eq(x + 3*p3 + 6*p4 + 10*p5 + 15*p6, total_intersections)
print(f"Equation: {equation}")
```
```output
Equation: Eq(x + 173, 780)
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 4: Solve the equation
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables and equation from previous steps
x = symbols('x')
equation = Eq(x + 173, 780)
# Solve the equation
solution = solve(equation, x)
print(f"Solution: x = {solution[0]}")
```
```output
Solution: x = 607
```
### END OF CODE
The final answer is \boxed{607}
