**Question (AIME 2024)**: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. 
In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. 
Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.


# SBSC response (Correct)

Let's approach this problem step by step using set theory and the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. We'll use SymPy to help us with the calculations.
### Step 1: Define the sets and their sizes
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Define the sets
D = 195  # Diamond ring owners
G = 367  # Golf club owners
S = 562  # Garden spade owners
C = 900  # Candy heart owners (all residents)
# Define the unknown
x = symbols('x')  # Number of people who own all four items
print(f"D = {D}, G = {G}, S = {S}, C = {C}")
print("x represents the number of people who own all four items")
```
```output
D = 195, G = 367, S = 562, C = 900
x represents the number of people who own all four items
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps 
### Step 2: Set up equations using Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables from previous step
D, G, S, C = 195, 367, 562, 900
x = symbols('x')
# Given information
exactly_two = 437
exactly_three = 234
# Let's define y as the number of people who own exactly one item
y = symbols('y')
# Equation based on Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
eq = Eq(y + exactly_two + exactly_three + x, C)
print("Equation based on Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:")
print(eq)
```
```output
Equation based on Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:
Eq(x + y + 671, 900)
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 3: Set up another equation using the given information
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables from previous steps
D, G, S, C = 195, 367, 562, 900
x, y = symbols('x y')
exactly_two = 437
exactly_three = 234
# Equation from previous step
eq1 = Eq(x + y + exactly_two + exactly_three, C)
# New equation based on the sum of all item ownerships
eq2 = Eq(y + 2*exactly_two + 3*exactly_three + 4*x, D + G + S + C)
print("Equation 1:", eq1)
print("Equation 2:", eq2)
```
```output
Equation 1: Eq(x + y + 671, 900)
Equation 2: Eq(4*x + y + 1576, 2024)
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem and leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 4: Solve the system of equations
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables and equations from previous steps
x, y = symbols('x y')
eq1 = Eq(x + y + 671, 900)
eq2 = Eq(4*x + y + 1576, 2024)
# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2))
print("Solution:", solution)
```
```output
Solution: {x: 73, y: 156}
```

### Step 5: Interpret the solution
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Reuse solution from previous step
solution = {x: 73, y: 156}
# Extract the value of x
x_value = solution[x]
print(f"The number of residents who own all four items is: {x_value}")
```
```output
The number of residents who own all four items is: 73
```

### END OF CODE
The final answer is \boxed{73}


# o1_mini response (Incorrect)

To solve this problem, let's interpret the given information carefully. 

First, everyone in Aimeville owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so we can consider that item as universally owned and focus on the other three items: a diamond ring (D), a set of golf clubs (G), and a garden spade (S). 

Given: - Total residents \( U = 900 \) - \( n(D) = 195 \) - \( n(G) = 367 \) - \( n(S) = 562 \) - Residents who own exactly two of the items \( (D, G, S) = 437 \) - Residents who own exactly three of the items \( (D, G, S) = 234 \) 

Since owning all four items (D, G, S, C) is equivalent to owning all three of \( D, G, S \) (because everyone already has \( C \)), the number of residents who own all four items is simply the number who own exactly three of \( D, G, S \). 

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is **234**. 

The answer is \boxed{234}
