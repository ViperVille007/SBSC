**Question (AIME 2022)**: Three spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19 are mutually externally tangent. 
A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at A, B, and C, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. 
Suppose that AB^2 = 560. Find AC^2.

Let's approach this problem step by step using SymPy-based Python code.

### Step 1: Import necessary libraries and define the variables

```python
from sympy import symbols, sqrt, Eq, solve
# Define the radii of the spheres
r1, r2, r3 = 11, 13, 19
# Define the distance between centers of spheres
d12, d13, d23 = symbols('d12 d13 d23')
# Define the distance from sphere centers to the plane
h1, h2, h3 = symbols('h1 h2 h3')
# Define the radius of the congruent circles
r = symbols('r')
print(f"Radii of spheres: {r1}, {r2}, {r3}")
print("Variables defined for distances and heights")
```
```output
Radii of spheres: 11, 13, 19
Variables defined for distances and heights
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem, leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 2: Set up equations for distances between sphere centers
```python
from sympy import symbols, sqrt, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables from previous step
r1, r2, r3 = 11, 13, 19
d12, d13, d23 = symbols('d12 d13 d23')
# Equations for distances between sphere centers
eq1 = Eq(d12, r1 + r2)
eq2 = Eq(d13, r1 + r3)
eq3 = Eq(d23, r2 + r3)
# Solve the equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (d12, d13, d23))
print("Distances between sphere centers:")
print(f"d12 = {solution[d12]}")
print(f"d13 = {solution[d13]}")
print(f"d23 = {solution[d23]}")
```
```output
Distances between sphere centers:
d12 = 24
d13 = 30
d23 = 32
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem, leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 3: Set up equations for the heights and radius of congruent circles
```python
from sympy import symbols, sqrt, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables from previous steps
r1, r2, r3 = 11, 13, 19
d12, d13, d23 = 24, 30, 32
h1, h2, h3, r = symbols('h1 h2 h3 r')
# Equations for the heights and radius of congruent circles
eq4 = Eq(r1**2 - r**2, h1**2)
eq5 = Eq(r2**2 - r**2, h2**2)
eq6 = Eq(r3**2 - r**2, h3**2)
# Equation for AB^2
eq7 = Eq(d12**2 - (h1 - h2)**2, 560)
print("Equations set up for heights and radius of congruent circles")
print("Equation for AB^2 set up")
```
```output
Equations set up for heights and radius of congruent circles
Equation for AB^2 set up
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem, leveraging the outputs of previous steps.
### Step 4: Solve the system of equations
```python
from sympy import symbols, sqrt, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables and equations from previous steps
r1, r2, r3 = 11, 13, 19
d12, d13, d23 = 24, 30, 32
h1, h2, h3, r = symbols('h1 h2 h3 r')
eq4 = Eq(r1**2 - r**2, h1**2)
eq5 = Eq(r2**2 - r**2, h2**2)
eq6 = Eq(r3**2 - r**2, h3**2)
eq7 = Eq(d12**2 - (h1 - h2)**2, 560)
# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7), (h1, h2, h3, r))
print("Solution:")
for var, value in solution[0].items():
    print(f"{var} = {value}")
```
```output
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'items'
```

I apologize for the error. It seems the solve function returned a tuple instead of a dictionary. Let's modify our code to handle this correctly:
### Step 4 (Corrected): Solve the system of equations
```python
from sympy import symbols, sqrt, Eq, solve
# Reuse variables and equations from previous steps

h1, h2, h3, r = symbols('h1 h2 h3 r')
eq4 = Eq(r1**2 - r**2, h1**2)
eq5 = Eq(r2**2 - r**2, h2**2)
eq6 = Eq(r3**2 - r**2, h3**2)
eq7 = Eq(d12**2 - (h1 - h2)**2, 560)
# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7), (h1, h2, h3, r))
print("Solution:")
for sol in solution:
    print(f"h1 = {sol[0]}")
    print(f"h2 = {sol[1]}")
    print(f"h3 = {sol[2]}")
    print(f"r = {sol[3]}")
    print()
```
```output
Solution:
h1 = -4
h2 = -8
h3 = -16
r = -sqrt(105)

h1 = -4
h2 = -8
h3 = -16
r = sqrt(105)

h1 = -4
h2 = -8
h3 = 16
r = -sqrt(105)

h1 = -4
h2 = -8
h3 = 16
r = sqrt(105)

h1 = 4
h2 = 8
h3 = -16
r = -sqrt(105)

h1 = 4
h2 = 8
h3 = -16
r = sqrt(105)

h1 = 4
h2 = 8
h3 = 16
r = -sqrt(105)

h1 = 4
h2 = 8
h3 = 16
r = sqrt(105)

h1, h2, h3, r = symbols('h1 h2 h3 r')
# Select the solution where all heights are positive and r is positive
correct_solution = [4, 8, 16, sqrt(105)]
print("Correct solution:")
print(f"h1 = {correct_solution[0]}")
print(f"h2 = {correct_solution[1]}")
print(f"h3 = {correct_solution[2]}")
print(f"r = {correct_solution[3]}")

r1, r2, r3 = 11, 13, 19
d13 = 30
h1, h3 = 4, 16
# Calculate AC^2
AC_squared = d13**2 - (h1 - h3)**2
print(f"AC^2 = {AC_squared}")
```
```output
