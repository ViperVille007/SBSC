**Question (AIME 2024)**:Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}. 
Find the least positive integer m such that m^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}. (202464)


Let's approach this problem step by step using SymPy-based Python code.

### Step 1: Import necessary libraries and define a function to check divisibility
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, prime, isprime, divisors
def is_divisible_by_p_squared(n, p):
    return (n**4 + 1) % (p**2) == 0
print("Function to check divisibility defined.")
```
```output
Function to check divisibility defined.
```

Let's continue with the next steps to solve this problem.
### Step 2: Find the least prime p that satisfies the condition
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, prime, isprime, divisors, nextprime
def is_divisible_by_p_squared(n, p):
    return (n**4 + 1) % (p**2) == 0
p = 2
found = False
while not found:
    for n in range(1, p):
        if is_divisible_by_p_squared(n, p):
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        p = nextprime(p)  # Get the next prime number
print(f"The least prime p that satisfies the condition is: {p}")
```
```output
timeout_decorator.timeout_decorator.TimeoutError: 'Timed Out'
```

I apologize for the continued timeout errors. It seems that this problem requires a more analytical approach rather than a brute-force search. 
Let's try a different method based on the mathematical properties of the expression n^4 + 1.
### Step 1: Analyze the expression n^4 + 1
```python
from sympy import symbols, expand, factor
n = symbols('n')
expression = n**4 + 1
print(f"Expression: {expression}")
print(f"Factored: {factor(expression)}")
```
```output
Expression: n**4 + 1
Factored: n**4 + 1
```

Let's analyze this further. The expression n^4 + 1 doesn't factor easily, but we can use some number theory to understand its properties.
### Step 2: Analyze the expression modulo different primes
```python
from sympy import symbols, expand, factor, mod_inverse
def analyze_mod_p(p):
    residues = set()
    for n in range(p):
        residue = (n**4 + 1) % p
        residues.add(residue)
    return residues
primes_to_check = [5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41]
for p in primes_to_check:
    residues = analyze_mod_p(p)
    print(f"Residues modulo {p}: {residues}")
    if 0 in residues:
        print(f"  {p} is a potential candidate")
```
```output
Residues modulo 5: {1, 2}
Residues modulo 13: {1, 2, 10, 4}
Residues modulo 17: {0, 1, 2, 5, 14}
  17 is a potential candidate
Residues modulo 29: {1, 2, 8, 17, 21, 24, 25, 26}
Residues modulo 37: {1, 2, 35, 34, 8, 10, 11, 13, 17, 27}
Residues modulo 41: {0, 1, 2, 32, 5, 38, 11, 17, 19, 24, 26}
  41 is a potential candidate
```

Based on our analysis, we can see that 17 and 41 are potential candidates for p. Let's verify if either of these satisfies the condition p^2 | (n^4 + 1) for some n.
### Step 3: Check if 17^2 or 41^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some n
```python
def check_divisibility(p):
    p_squared = p**2
    for n in range(1, p_squared):
        if (n**4 + 1) % p_squared == 0:
            return n
    return None
p = 17
n = check_divisibility(p)
if n:
    print(f"{p}^2 divides {n}^4 + 1")
else:
    print(f"{p}^2 does not divide n^4 + 1 for any n < {p}^2")
p = 41
n = check_divisibility(p)
if n:
    print(f"{p}^2 divides {n}^4 + 1")
else:
    print(f"{p}^2 does not divide n^4 + 1 for any n < {p}^2")
```
```output
17^2 divides 110^4 + 1
41^2 divides 776^4 + 1
```

Based on our analysis, we have found that both 17^2 and 41^2 divide n^4 + 1 for some n. 
However, the question asks for the least prime p that satisfies this condition. Therefore, p = 17 is our answer.
### Step 4: Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2
```python
def check_divisibility(p):
    p_squared = p**2
    for n in range(1, p_squared):
        if (n**4 + 1) % p_squared == 0:
            return n
    return None
p = 17
p_squared = p**2
m = check_divisibility(p)
print(f"The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by {p}^2 is: {m}")
```
```output
The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 is: 110
```

### END OF CODE
The answer is \boxed{110}
